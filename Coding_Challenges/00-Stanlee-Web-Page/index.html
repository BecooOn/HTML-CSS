              Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28,
              1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer,
              editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a
              family-run business called Timely Comics which would later become
              Marvel Comics. He was the primary creative leader for two decades,
              leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house
              to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film
              industries. In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly
              co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic
              characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man,
              Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black
              Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black
              Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s
              pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and in
              the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code
              Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the
              1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other
              media, with mixed results. Following his retirement from Marvel in
              the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company. He
              frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows
              based on Marvel properties on which he received an executive
              producer credit, which allowed him to become the highest-grossing
              person in film of all time by a large margin.[2] He continued
              independent creative ventures into his 90s until his death in
              2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner
              Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in
              1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.
